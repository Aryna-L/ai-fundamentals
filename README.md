## What It Demonstrates

Working example of AEO principles. Every page built using question-first architecture, direct answers, FAQ schema, and semantic HTML.

## Content Structure Template

Every concept page follows this pattern:

```html
<h1>What is [Concept]?</h1>

<p>[Direct answer: 2-3 sentences defining concept, why it matters, key benefit]</p>

<h2>How Does [Concept] Work?</h2>
<p>[Direct answer first, then details...]</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of [Concept]?</h2>
<p>[Direct answer first, then bullet points...]</p>

<h2>When Should You Use [Concept]?</h2>
<p>[Direct answer first, then use cases...]</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
[4-6 Q&A pairs]

```

## Actual Performance

### Average Scores

**Content Pages:** 88/100

- Schema: 15/15 ✅ (Article + FAQPage on every page)
- FAQ: 10/10 ✅ (dedicated sections + schema)
- Questions: 10/10 ✅ (all H2s are questions)
- Headers: 10/10 ✅ (proper hierarchy)
- Answers: 38/40 (excellent direct answers)
- Depth: 5/15 (intentionally concise)

**Homepage:** ~75/100 (lower because it's navigational, not content-focused)

## Why It Works

1. **Consistency** - Same pattern on every page makes AI parsing predictable
2. **Direct Answers** - No fluff before the answer
3. **Question Alignment** - Headers match how people ask questions
4. **Schema Completeness** - Both Article and FAQPage
5. **Semantic HTML** - Proper use of `<article>`, `<section>`, headings

## Key Lesson

**Answer quality matters most.** The site scores 38/40 on answer coverage because:

- First paragraph always defines the concept
- Each section starts with a direct answer
- Content is actually useful (not just optimized for metrics)

This demonstrates that **good AEO improves readability** rather than compromising it.

# Cross-Tool Workflow

## Complete Site Audit

1. **Quick Scan (Scanner)** - Get baseline scores for all pages
2. **Prioritize** - Focus on pages scoring < 70
3. **Deep Analysis (Auditor Pro)** - Understand why scores are low
4. **Implement (Schema Builder)** - Generate and add schema
5. **Restructure** - Fix content based on recommendations
6. **Validate (Scanner)** - Re-scan to confirm improvement
7. **Monitor** - Monthly scans to track changes

**Time for 10-page site:** 4-6 hours

## New Content Creation

1. **Structure** - Use AI Fundamentals as template
2. **Write** - Question-first, direct answers
3. **Schema (Schema Builder)** - Generate Article + FAQPage
4. **Validate (Scanner)** - Check score before publishing
5. **Refine (Auditor Pro if needed)** - If score < 85, get specific fixes
6. **Publish** - Deploy with schema

**Target score before publishing:** 85+

# Quick Reference

## When to Use Which Tool

**Need fast scoring?** → Scanner

**Don't understand why score is low?** → Auditor Pro

**Need to add schema?** → Schema Builder

**Want to see best practices?** → AI Fundamentals Hub

## Most Important Factors for AI Citations

1. **Answer Quality (40 points)** - Direct, clear answers in opening paragraphs
2. **Schema Markup (15 points)** - Valid JSON-LD (Article + FAQPage combo best)
3. **FAQ Structure (10 points)** - Dedicated sections with Q&A pairs
4. **Question Headers (10 points)** - H2/H3 tags as actual questions
5. **Everything else (25 points)** - Header hierarchy, content depth

## Common Mistakes

❌ Adding schema but not improving answer quality

❌ Having FAQ schema without dedicated FAQ section

❌ Writing headers as statements instead of questions

❌ Burying answers deep in content

❌ Optimizing for score instead of actual answer quality

## Success Metrics

- **Target Score:** 85+ for important pages
- **Schema Coverage:** 100% of content pages
- **Answer Coverage:** 35+/40 points
- **Question Headers:** 60%+ of H2/H3 tags
